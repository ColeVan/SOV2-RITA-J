# Security Onion RITA-J Notebook

This project is for finding a solution to use Security Onion Elastic data with Jupyter Notebooks. 

The goal is to use the notebook in the link below with Security Onion for beacon detection capabilities.

So far I am able to pull back data from Security Onion using the elastic API. Please see Zeek-Network-Hunting.ipynb above.
